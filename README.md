Everyone can be a chef

During the hight of the Pandemic, a friend and entrepreneurial major idea to create an applicaiton to help regular people monitize their new and old cooking skills.
I saw this as an opportunity to learn React.
Folks can sign up as a chef or a consumer. Chefs can upload details about the food they can make, consumers can purchase said food.
We used Firebase as a backend, and we had help from a third person in Milwaukee.
His semester ended, I got a job with Best Buy, the third person gave up on the idea, and I left with more skills in React.
